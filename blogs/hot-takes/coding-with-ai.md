# Coding with AI
### 2025-07-12

#### Warning: this is a very hot take. If you want an unbiased opinion, you should probably stop reading now.

I won't lie to you, as of typing this, I currently have GitHub Copilot enabled in my editor. Is it helpful? Yes, definitely. Is it perfect? No, not at all.

## The Good

Often, we have to perform repetitive and meaningless tasks in our code, such as copying titles on all blogs on a site (guess who just had to do that!). With AI coding tools like Copilot, we can simply prompt the LLM to do it for us, and pour a cup of tea while it does the work.

Does this save us time? Definitely! Does it save our sanity? Absolutely!

## The Bad

AI coding tools are far from perfect. Although they excel at performing menial tasks, they are less good at performing tasks that require planning ahead, or interacting with large codebases.

Believe me, I've tried telling Copilot to implement a feature in my chess engine, and it completely failed.

Additionally, AI coding tools are very good at missing your point. While designing this site, I came across something I didn't know how to do, so I asked Copilot how to do it. While it did provide a solution, it also redesigned the entire site - something I never asked for.

## "Vibecoding"

Recently, we've seen an increase in "vibecoders" - people who use AI tools to create entire projects while knowing very little about the underlying technology. Usually, their products all look the same (literally look at any vibecoded site), and their sites also, frankly, perform like *garbage*.

While there is an argument to be made that vibecoding allows for people who wouldn't normally be able to build sites to do so, I ultimately believe that it leads to a slippery slope of bad design and poor user experiences.

Take, as an example, a project I'm currently participating in - Hack Club's "Summer of Making". This project is focused on encouraging young people to learn about technology and code their own projects. Unfortunately, the site itself is a prime example of vibecoding gone wrong. It's slow, unresponsive, and the site itself just feels very sketchy.

This is not to say that the Summer of Making is a bad initiative - it definitely isn't. But, I frankly have to question why people who couldn't be bothered to code their website from scratch are the ones teaching others to code.

Furthermore, vibecoding can lead to disastrous consequences when it comes to security. There have been several instances where people have used AI tools to build applications that have several vulnerabilities, **even leaking API keys**.

AI coding tools should be used like a tutor. They should help you figure out why something isn't working, or give you general guidelines on how to implement a feature. They should not be used as a replacement for actual coding knowledge.

## Copilot in 2021

When GitHub Copilot was first launched, I hurriedly signed up for the technical preview. It was very impressive at first, but even eighth-grade me could see that it had several flaws. The code it suggested was often wrong, sometimes making no sense.

But, it was still a very useful tool. It helped me write code faster, and I could simply ignore the suggestions that didn't make sense.

It is regrettable that while Copilot has definitely improved since then, it has become more of a crutch than a tool. People have become so reliant on it that they can't even write a simple function without it.

## Future?

I sincerely hope that in the future, we as developers won't become so reliant on AI coding tools that we forget how to code ourselves. These tools can be very useful, but they should not be a replacement for actual learning and understanding.
