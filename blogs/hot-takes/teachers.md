# Judges should know what they judge
### 2025-07-13

A couple of years ago, I participated in a hackathon. My team worked painstakingly to create an [online judge for competitive programming](https://github.com/pzoj/pzoj). We were genuinely proud of our product, and we were excited to present it.

After we had presented, we thought we had done well. The judges, on the other hand, stared with blank faces. They had no idea what we were talking about, and they didn't even bother to ask questions. They just sat there, looking at us like we were speaking a foreign language.

"Okay, thanks for your presentation!"

Well, maybe they were just stunned by the sheer brilliance of our project, right? Fast forward to the closing ceremony, and our project was not even mentioned. The first place winner? A static page that just made queries to the ChatGPT API.

Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. And it's not just computer science.

Another couple of years ago, I was in a debate tournament. The motion was: "This House Believes That we should prioritize women's sports". Since this was the Canadian National format and my partner and I were proposition, we were able to define both "This House" and "prioritize". We defined "prioritize women's sports" as "to provide more publicity to women's sports, but not necessarily overshadowing men's sports".

The opposition's entire argument was based on how prioritizing women's sports would cause men's sports to lose funding, and how this would be unfair.

Both my partner and I were pretty confused, but we just thought to ourselves, "Well, that's an easy win."

After all the rebuttals, we had quite literally knocked down every single argument the opposition made, and made it as clear to the judges as possible that the opposition was completely missing our point.

Guess who won? The opposition, who kept arguing against a strawman.

The issue in this case is that the judges were parents - they hadn't done debate themselves, and were probably unwillingly dragged into judging. I'd much rather attend less debate tournaments if it meant that we could have high quality judges every time.

## The point

I was definitely disappointed in these two situations, but they are ultimately parent of a bigger problem.

While wanting to create opportunities for people to showcase their work is great, it is necessary that the judges know what they are judging. Otherwise, it's just a waste of everyone's time.

Furthermore, it discourages people from participating in these events, in fear that their work will not be understood by the very people who are supposed to evaluate it.

If we want to create an environment where people can have their work be judged fairly, we should ensure that the judges and organizers are knowledgeable about the topic, and not just organizing an event for the sake of it.
