# The USACO Is Unenjoyable
### 2025-07-16

I would like to apologize in advance to Mr. Chongtian Ma for writing this blog post.

The USACO, or the USA Computing Olympiad, is **the** competitive programming contest for high school students in the US. People who do well in the USACO are selected to represent the US in the IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics). The USACO is split into four divisions: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.

While the problem-setters put a lot of effort into the USACO and I believe that some very cool problems have been created for it, I believe that the USACO has some fundamental flaws that make me prefer other countries' olympiads, such as the COCI (Croatian Olympiad in Informatics) or the CCC (Canadian Computing Competition).

## Too Syllabus-based

The USACO Guide is an unofficial site that provides topics to study for each division of the USACO, and while it serves as a great resource, it can lead to people simply grinding the syllabus instead of actually learning how to solve problems.

While this isn't inherently a bad thing, I find it a bit bizarre that you can quite literally grind your way to a division by simply learning a set of concepts. Often, you can tell what concept a problem is testing just from looking at it. The challenge then becomes simply applying the concept (and figuring out some implementation details), which really isn't the same as actually solving a problem.

Plus, the prevalence of the USACO Guide can lead to problem-setters specifically making problems that test concepts in the syllabus - otherwise, they risk facing backlash for "testing concepts outside the guide".

## Too Few Problems

Each division has only 3 problems per contest, whereas other countries' olympiads usually have 5 problems per contest. Furthermore, the USACO contest window is significantly longer than other countries' olympiads, with the USACO contests lasting 4-5 hours, while most other olympiads last only 3 hours. For me at least, this makes the problem-solving experience feel very dry and draining.

The format of the USACO is very different from almost every other contest - instead of having problems that start easy and get harder, the USACO problems are usually all the same difficulty, based on the division.

## Intended solutions are often too implementation-heavy

After staring at my screen for 3 hours trying to figure out why my solution was getting Wrong Answer, I often find that the intended solution is a very long implementation of a concept that doesn't feel quite elegant or nice. This is especially true for higher divisions, like Gold and Platinum.

While I do acknowledge that setting difficult problems inherently leads to more complex solutions, I feel like the USACO often goes too far in this regard. The solutions often feel like they are just a long series of steps that you have to follow, rather than a clever insight or a neat trick.

## Other Olympiads

I come from Canada, so I am way more familiar with the CCC. I learned competitive programming with the CCC, and I still think it is a great contest. Most of the time, CCC problems are very elegant and have neat solutions that are very clean and easy to understand. There isn't any official syllabus, but the problems are still very well-balanced and cover a wide range of topics. The subtasking system is also very well-designed, mimicking the IOI system.

Although there have been several controversies regarding the CCC, I still maintain my stance that it is a great contest. It is very difficult to "fluke" or "grind" your way to a good score, since you don't know what each problem will test. In fact, the S3, often considered the "make-or-break" problem, is often a very interesting ad hoc problem that requires a lot of thought to solve, rather than just a simple application of an algorithm.

## Conclusion

The USACO is by no means a bad contest, and I respect the problem-setters greatly. However, I still think that it could be improved to be a more enjoyable experience for participants.
