# The SAT Isn't That Bad
### 2025-07-16

Okay, I know you saw the title and clicked on this article so that you could roast me, but hear me out. The SAT is actually a decent test of readiness for college, and while it has its flaws, it is not as bad as people make it out to be.

For those who don't know, the SAT is a standardized test that is mostly used for college admissions in the US. It consists of two sections: math and reading/writing, each scored out of 800 points, for a total score of 1600. Most selective colleges require students to submit their SAT scores as part of their application, and many students retake the test multiple times to maximize their score.

## The Flaws of the SAT

Naturally, such a widely used test has its flaws. The most obvious one is that it is a single test that is supposed to measure a student's "readiness" for college, which is already a very subjective term. Also, since it only measures math and reading/writing skills, it does not take other important skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving into account - skills that are actually important for success in life as a whole.

Additionally, since students can take the SAT multiple times, it can lead to students who have more money being able to take it far more times, while those from lower-income backgrounds may not have the same opportunities to retake the test.

Finally, since it is just a test, it doesn't consider factors such as what a student is currently going through. What if a student is definitely capable of getting a good score, but is currently going through a rough time in their life? The SAT does not take this into account, and it can lead to students being unfairly judged based on a single test score.

## The Benefits of the SAT

Despite its flaws, the SAT has its benefits as well. For one, it is a standardized test, which means that it is the same for everyone and can be used to provide a statistically consistent measure of a student's skills. It also is usually pretty accurate at predicting how a student will do in college.

Most of the time, smart and prepared students score well on the SAT. While it may be argued that the SAT penalizes students who aren't good at taking tests, the reality is that students who aren't good at taking tests will also struggle in college, where tests are a common way to measure a student's understanding of the material. The SAT is not perfect, but it's a pretty good measure in the American education system.

Plus, the SAT can actually bridge the gap between high-income and low-income students. While it is true that students from higher-income backgrounds can afford to take the SAT multiple times, the reality is that most college admissions committees will only consider the SAT as a very minor part of the application. The SAT itself is not the problem causing the gap, but rather the fact that students from lower-income backgrounds usually can't do things like create a startup or do research at a university, things that matter a lot more than the SAT score itself. The SAT is just a symptom of the problem, not the cause.

Another counterargument is that the SAT is biased against people who are not native English speakers, and while this is true, the reality is that students who are not proficient in English will struggle even more in English-speaking colleges, where all courses and materials are in English. The language barrier is a real issue, and again, the SAT is just a symptom of the problem, not the cause.

## Conclusion

The SAT is not a perfect test, but it is by no means an invalid measure of a student's skills. It definitely has its flaws, but ultimately, I believe that it should still be used as one of many tools in the college admissions process. By considering the SAT alongside other factors such as high school GPA, extracurricular activities, and personal essays, colleges can gain a better understanding of a student's potential.

To end off this post, I'd like to ask you one final question: if we remove the SAT as part of the college admissions process in order to make them "fair" regardless of a student's background, what other parts of the application process would have to be removed? You will quickly find that once all the "unfair" parts of the application process are removed, there is nothing left at all on your paper - not even a name.
