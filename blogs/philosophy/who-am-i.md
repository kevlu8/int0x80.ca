# Who Am I?

Who am I?

Sure, we could answer that question with the objective truth: my name is Kevin, I am 17 years old, I am Canadian, I like programming, etc. But that doesn't really answer the question.

Who am I?

I'm typing this blog with my fingers on my laptop. But am I my fingers? Am I my body? Am I my brain? Who is experiencing my life?

I don't know.

I don't know who this "experiencer" is. Sure, I can say that I am Kevin, but what does that even mean? Is Kevin just a collection of memories and experiences? Is Kevin just a name that people call me? If I were to lose all my memories and start all over again, would I still be Kevin?

What if this experiencer - this consciousness - is the same for everyone? Do we all start as the same, then diverge as our experiences shape us?

Our brains aren't perfect. We convince ourselves things that aren't true, we forget things, and so on. What's to say that my brain isn't just hallucinating my entire life? Does this mean that other people don't exist either? That they're just figments of my imagination?

Do other animals also have consciousness? How do we even know if something is conscious?

What even is consciousness? Is it just a phenomenon because of how complex our brains are? If so, what happens when we die? Our brains stop functioning - does that mean our consciousness ceases to exist? Or does it continue on in some form?

What defines someone, or something, as conscious? Is it the ability to metacognize? To think about thinking? To have self-awareness?

I don't know.

I don't know who I am. I don't know who you are. I don't know what consciousness is. I don't know what life is. I don't know what death is.

It's really frustrating, isn't it? We're actually not as technologically advanced as we think we are. We figured out how to make rocks think. We figured out how to use just the right combination of chemicals to send people to the moon. Hell, we even figured out how to stimulate just the right neurons in our brains to make us hallucinate.

But we don't know that much about *ourselves*.

While not everyone will fly to the moon, one thing that everyone will do is die. And yet, we don't know anything about what happens after we die.

Religion tries to answer this question, but it doesn't offer any concrete evidence. Sure, it's comforting to think we know what happens after we die, but no matter how devout you are, you can't know for sure. You can only believe.

When I was younger, I thought about these questions a lot. But it never really bothered me that much. I came up with a ton of theories - reincarnation, being God, etc. - and I was content with that. But now, I find myself thinking about these questions more and more.

I'm not going to die anytime soon, but I know that one day I will. And I don't know what will happen then.

I don't want to fade into nothingness.

I don't want to just stop existing.

Paradoxically, I want to *live* after I die.

I want to meet family members again. I want to say hi to people I looked up to. I want to see what happens in the future.

I want to *know*.

But I don't know if that's possible. I don't know if I'll ever find out.

And maybe that's okay.
