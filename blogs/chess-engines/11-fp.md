# Futility Pruning
### 2025-07-04

Our engine is now at a decent level. But, if you look closely, you will see that it still searches a lot of positions that are kind of not worth searching. For example, if we are 1 move away from the horizon and are -500cp, and our alpha (best score we have found so far) is 100cp, there's really no reason to continue this search.

This is where we use *futility pruning*. Futility pruning is a technique (applied near the horizon) where we skip searching positions that are unlikely to improve our score.

Futility pruning is a kind of "move-loop pruning", meaning that we skip searching moves that are unlikely to improve our score. Essentially, if the evaluation of the position plus a margin is still less than alpha, and the move is quiet, we can skip it.

We should not apply futility pruning at positions where:
- We are in check
- The current move being searched is a capture or promotion (can raise score significantly)
- We are not near the horizon
- We are near mate (since FP can lead to missing mates)
- The current move being searched is the hash move

```cpp
if (!in_check && !is_capt && !is_promo && m_idx > 0 && depth == 1 && abs(alpha) < VALUE_MATE_MAX_PLY && abs(beta) < VALUE_MATE_MAX_PLY) {
	// Futility pruning
	if (raw_eval + FP_MARGIN < alpha) continue;
}
```

The value you should use for `FP_MARGIN` is usually around 200-300cp, but you can experiment with this value to find the best one for your engine.

We can also employ futility pruning at higher depths, but the margin should be much larger. It does gain ELO for me, so it's worth trying!

```
Elo   | 3.08 +- 2.48 (95%)
SPRT  | 8.0+0.08s Threads=1 Hash=32MB
LLR   | 2.95 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00]
Games | N: 31396 W: 7625 L: 7347 D: 16424
Penta | [702, 3526, 7016, 3700, 754]

## Late Move Pruning

Similar to futility pruning, we can also skip searching moves that are ordered near the very back of our move list. This is called late move pruning (LMP)!

```cpp
if (!pv && m_idx > 5 + depth * depth && !in_check && !capt && !promo && abs(alpha) < VALUE_MATE_MAX_PLY && abs(beta) < VALUE_MATE_MAX_PLY) {
	/**
	* Late move pruning
	* 
	* Prune off late moves (that's literally it)
	*/
	continue;
}
```

It's pretty intuitive and not too difficult to implement.
