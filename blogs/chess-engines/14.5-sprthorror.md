# SPRT Horror Stories
### 2025-07-07

Okay, seeing as I'm *still* waiting for the SPRT results for IIR (post 13), CMH (post 14), and CaptHist (post 14), I thought I'd share some of the worst experiences I've had with SPRT.

## The 80000 Game SPRT

Cutnode negative extensions - a technique where we reduce the search depth after singular extensions for cutnodes - was something I implemented a while ago. I was expecting maybe 5-10 Elo from it, but boy was I wrong.

```
Elo   | 1.09 +- 1.29 (95%)
SPRT  | 8.0+0.08s Threads=1 Hash=32MB
LLR   | 1.00 (-2.25, 2.89) [0.00, 3.00]
Games | N: 86252 W: 19221 L: 18950 D: 48081
Penta | [677, 10398, 20775, 10529, 747]
```

It didn't finish after over 80,000 games. I merged it anyway.

## Flip Flop

This happened to me when I was contributing to Stockfish. I implemented a new search feature, and it passed STC pretty easily. I then ran it on LTC, and it reached 2.80 LLR after a few hundred thousand games. It was the last stretch!!!!

It dropped to -2.94 and failed.

## The Scariest of them All

I open my bank account. I see several bills from Google, totalling over $200. Why did I even get into this hobby?
