# SPRT Horror Stories
### 2025-07-07

Okay, seeing as I'm *still* waiting for the SPRT results for IIR (post 13), CMH (post 14), and CaptHist (post 14), I thought I'd share some of the worst experiences I've had with SPRT.

## The 40000 Game SPRT

Static Evaluation Correction History. Wow. What a mouthful. It was the "latest tech" in the engine development scene, and I was eager to try it out. I've heard people talking about huge Elo gains, so my expectations were high.

I was expecting *at least* a 10 Elo gain, so I was expecting the SPRT to finish in a couple thousand games (5000-ish?). I was wrong. Very wrong.

```
Elo   | 2.48 +- 1.96 (95%)
SPRT  | 8.0+0.08s Threads=1 Hash=32MB
LLR   | 2.96 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00]
Games | N: 41582 W: 8045 L: 7748 D: 25789
Penta | [598, 4601, 10148, 4794, 650]
```

It finished after over 48 hours of testing, and I was left with a measly 2.48 Elo gain. Oh well...

## Flip Flop

This has happened to me almost every time I run an SPRT. I run the SPRT, and it starts out with a huge Elo gain. Yes! Finally!

Mere minutes later, it starts to drop. And drop. And drop. All of a sudden, my +50 Elo turned into a -20 Elo. Man..

It doesn't stop there. The SPRT goes back up! Then, it settles in that range just above 0. I end up with a measly 2 Elo gain after 10,000 games.

## The Scariest of them All

I open my bank account. I see several bills from Google, totalling over $200. Why did I even get into this hobby?
