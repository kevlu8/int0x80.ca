# NNUE Series Introduction
### 2025-10-11

Hello! If you're here, you've probably read through my search series (or at least parts of it) and are interested in learning about evaluation in chess engines.

I will be focusing on NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Network), which is by far the most common evaluation method in modern chess engines. They are decently recent, having first been introduced to chess in 2020. However, they are responsible for the hundreds of Elo points of improvement that we have seen in chess engines over the past few years. If we look at the top engines on the CCRL list before NNUE, we see Stockfish 10 at 3491 Elo. Now, Stockfish 17.1 is at 3787 Elo, being able to completely obliterate Stockfish 10.

I will be assuming that you have a basic understanding of chess engines and how they work. If you haven't read my search series yet, I highly recommend you do so before continuing with this series. You can find it [here](https://int0x80.ca/posts/chess-engines/1-intro).
